The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to migrate a portion of their infrastructure to the Azure cloud incrementally. As part of this migration, you are tasked with creating an Azure Virtual Machine (VM).

The requirements are:

1) Use the existing resource group.

2) The VM name must be xfusion-vm, it should be in centralus region.

3) Use the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image for the VM.

4) The VM size must be Standard_B1s.

5) Attach a default Network Security Group (NSG) that allows inbound SSH (port 22).

6) Attach a 30 GB storage disk of type Standard HDD.

7) The rest of the configurations should remain as default.

After completing these steps, make sure you can SSH into the virtual machine.
